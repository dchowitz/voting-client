The result of my walkthrough of the excellent in-depth [Full-Stack Redux Tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html) by [@teropa](https://twitter.com/teropa).

This is the client part. Make sure to have the [voting-server](https://github.com/dchowitz/voting-client) running. Then install all dependencies and start the client.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Finally, the voting screen should be available at `http://localhost:8080` and the results screen at `http://localhost:8080/#/results`.
